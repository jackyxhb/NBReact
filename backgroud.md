# Background (An email from an employer)

This is a test invitation from an employer. Mock or simulate such a test in an interactive way for me to familiarise myself with the test.

- Simulate the whole process of HackerRank for each question.
- Provide a window for the user to repeat running the code to debug what has changed.

"Hi, thanks for your interest in a Developer role at XXX.
The next step of our recruitment process is some technical exercises.
I have sent through a link to HackerRank so that you can complete the exercises in your own time. The assessment has a total of 5 questions and has a time frame of either 90 or 120 minutes (depending on whether you choose to complete all 5 questions). This is our general assessment; the questions cover a range of technologies; we do not expect candidates to demonstrate expertise in all areas. Instead, the assessment intends to identify your areas of technical strength.
You will be given an option as to what questions you would like to complete, e.g.

Full stack developer - React focussed (90 minute time frame)
Complete questions 1, 3, 4, 5.
Full stack developer - Front-end (90 minute time frame)
Complete 1 or 2, as well as 3, 4, 5.
Full stack developer - all other (120 minute time frame)
Complete all questions
Please select the questions based on your expertise. For example, if your expertise is primarily in React choose the React Focused questions. If you are equally comfortable across all technologies choose the Full Stack Developer questions.
The test allows you to skip questions. If you are not familiar with React, please do not attempt the question and skip to the VanillaJS question and so on. Please use your time attempting areas of confidence and go back to the others if there is time remaining.
This exercise is to show us your level of expertise across some of the technologies that we use at XXX, so please do not use any AI tools to complete the answers. "
